        <h2 class="section-title">The Dribble Drive System</h2>
        <p>Basketball is trending toward positionless play. The days of rigid lineups with a traditional 1-through-5 are fading. If you want your team to play the way the modern game is evolving, the Dribble Drive Motion Offense is one of the best systems you can install.</p>
        <p>Built on one core principle — attack the gaps — the Dribble Drive makes every player on the floor a potential driver. Every drive creates a reaction from the defense that opens up a teammate. It's aggressive, it's unpredictable, and it's devastating when executed properly.</p>
        <p>This book takes you from the basic concepts to advanced reads, with drills to install each piece, quick hitters for structured possessions, and secondary break options to score in transition.</p>
