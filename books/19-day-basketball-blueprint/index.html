        <h2 class="section-title">19 Days. Real Results.</h2>
        <p>Most basketball improvement guides give you a laundry list of drills with no structure. You end up doing random exercises with no clear progression, wondering why your game isn't getting better. The 19 Day Basketball Blueprint takes a different approach.</p>
        <p>This is a structured, day-by-day plan that builds on itself. Each day focuses on specific fundamentals — shooting, passing, dribbling, and game IQ — with clear progressions that compound over the 19-day period. By the end, you'll have built real, lasting habits that translate directly to game performance.</p>
        <p>Whether you're a player looking to level up before tryouts, a parent training with your kid, or a coach designing an offseason program — this blueprint gives you the roadmap.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:32px; font-size:1.3rem;">What You'll Learn</h3>
