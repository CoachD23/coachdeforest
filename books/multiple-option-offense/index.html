        <h2 class="section-title">Why the Multiple Option Offense?</h2>
        <p>If you've ever watched Kansas play under Bill Self, you've seen something that looks effortless — but is anything but. The Jayhawks run a system built on reads, not memorization. Players learn to exploit whatever the defense gives them, making every possession dangerous.</p>
        <p>This book breaks down the Multiple Option Offense into teachable, installable pieces. Whether you want to focus on a high/low attack or a ball screen-heavy approach, the system adapts to your personnel — not the other way around.</p>
