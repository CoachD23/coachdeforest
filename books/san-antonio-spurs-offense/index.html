        <h2 class="section-title">The Spurs Offensive System</h2>
        <p>The San Antonio Spurs dynasty wasn't built on individual talent alone. It was built on a system — one that emphasized ball movement, player movement, and unselfish decision-making. And the principles behind that system work just as well in your gym as they did in the AT&T Center.</p>
        <p>This book is a complete breakdown of the Spurs offense. You'll learn the "how" and the "why" behind every set, with detailed diagrams and coaching notes that make the system teachable at any level. Gregg Popovich's philosophy comes alive through the X's and O's.</p>
        <p>From the motion principles to specific play calls, from secondary breaks to late-game situations — this is the most comprehensive Spurs offensive playbook available.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:32px; font-size:1.3rem;">What You'll Learn</h3>
