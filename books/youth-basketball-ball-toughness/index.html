        <h2 class="section-title">What Is Ball Toughness?</h2>
        <p>Ball toughness isn't a physical attribute — it's a mentality. It's the ability to handle pressure, absorb contact, and make strong decisions with the basketball when the defense is in your face. Championship teams aren't just talented — they're tough with the ball.</p>
        <p>This book gives you the drills and strategies to build ball toughness at every level, from youth rec leagues to varsity programs. Every drill has been used in real practices and real games — not borrowed from theory, but forged on the court.</p>
        <p>You'll learn how to structure practices that develop players who protect the basketball, make strong moves under pressure, and execute when the game is on the line.</p>
