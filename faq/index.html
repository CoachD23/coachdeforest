          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>It depends on your needs. If you're looking for a complete offensive system, start with <a href="/books/multiple-option-offense/">A Multiple Option System</a> — it's the most popular and has 83+ reviews. If you coach youth basketball, <a href="/books/youth-basketball-ball-toughness/">Practice Drills for Ball Toughness</a> is the best starting point. For individual player development, try <a href="/books/19-day-basketball-blueprint/">The 19 Day Basketball Blueprint</a>.</p>
