Bad shooting form is the hardest habit to break in basketball. Players practice their broken shot thousands of times, and then wonder why they can't shoot consistently.

The fix isn't more repetitions of bad form. The fix is rebuilding from scratch — in a structured, progressive way.

## Why Most Shooting Drills Don't Work

The typical approach: shoot 200 shots and hope your form improves. The problem? If your form is wrong, you're just getting 200 reps of wrong form. You're making the problem worse, not better.

Effective shooting improvement requires isolation. Break the shot into components, fix each component individually, then reassemble.

## The 7-Day Shooting Reset

**Day 1: One-Hand Form Shots.**

Stand three feet from the basket. Shoot with your shooting hand only. Focus on three things: elbow under the ball, wrist snap, and follow-through. Make 50 shots. If you miss, it's because your form broke — reset and try again.

**Day 2: Guide Hand Integration.**

Same distance, but add the guide hand. The guide hand does one job: hold the ball in place until the shooting hand takes over. It should not push, twist, or influence the shot. Make 50 shots.

**Day 3: Step-Back to 8 Feet.**

With both hands, shoot from eight feet. Maintain the same form from Days 1-2. The only thing that changes is your legs generate more power. Make 50 shots from four different spots.

**Day 4: Catch-and-Shoot.**

Have someone pass you the ball (or throw it off the wall). Catch, set your feet, and shoot. The goal is to maintain form while adding the complexity of a catch. 50 reps.

**Day 5: One-Dribble Pull-Up.**

Start from the triple-threat position. Take one dribble, stop on a dime, and shoot. This adds movement, which is where most players' form breaks down. 50 reps from each side.

**Day 6: Spot-Up Shooting.**

Move to five spots on the floor: both corners, both wings, and the top of the key. Shoot five shots from each spot. Focus on consistency — same form from every spot.

**Day 7: Pressure Shooting.**

Shoot free throws under fatigue. Run a sprint, then shoot two free throws. Repeat 10 times. If your form holds up under fatigue, you've rebuilt it properly.

## The Key: Patience

The hardest part of a shooting reset is trusting the process. On Day 1, you'll feel ridiculous shooting from three feet away. But that's where the foundation is built.

Every great shooter — Curry, Ray Allen, Larry Bird — has perfect form from three feet. If you can't shoot perfectly from close range, you can't shoot consistently from anywhere else.
