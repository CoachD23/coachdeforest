You don't need a fancy gym, a personal trainer, or expensive equipment to get better at basketball. You need a ball, a hoop, and 45 minutes.

The best players in the world didn't become great at elite training facilities. They became great in driveways, at local parks, and in empty gyms — putting in work when nobody was watching.

## The 45-Minute Daily Workout

This workout is designed to be done alone. No partner needed. All you need is a basketball and a hoop.

**Block 1: Ball Handling (12 minutes)**

Start every workout with ball handling. This builds confidence, coordination, and the foundation for everything else.

- 2 min: Stationary pound dribbles (right hand, left hand, alternating)
- 2 min: Figure eights (around both legs, continuous)
- 2 min: Crossover series (in-and-out, behind the back, between the legs)
- 2 min: Full-court dribbling (sprint to half court and back, two times each hand)
- 2 min: Two-ball dribbling (if you have two balls; if not, repeat full-court)
- 2 min: Combo moves (crossover to behind-the-back, hesitation to spin, etc.)

**Block 2: Shooting (18 minutes)**

This is the meat of the workout. Follow the progression:

- 3 min: Form shots from 5 feet (one hand, then two hands)
- 3 min: Mid-range shooting from 5 spots (elbow, wing, baseline, opposite elbow, free throw)
- 3 min: Three-point shooting from 5 spots
- 3 min: Catch-and-shoot off the wall (throw the ball off the wall, catch, and shoot)
- 3 min: One-dribble pull-ups (attack from triple threat, one dribble, pull up)
- 3 min: Free throws (track your makes — try to hit 7/10 or better)

**Block 3: Finishing (8 minutes)**

- 2 min: Right-hand layups (full speed from the wing)
- 2 min: Left-hand layups (full speed from the opposite wing)
- 2 min: Floaters (drive into the lane, pull up for a floater before the rim)
- 2 min: Power finishes (drive hard, jump stop, finish through contact with the rim)

**Block 4: Conditioning (7 minutes)**

- 3 min: Full-court dribble sprints (go hard for 30 seconds, rest 15, repeat 4 times)
- 2 min: Defensive slides (baseline to half court and back, three times)
- 2 min: Free throws under fatigue (shoot 2, sprint to half court and back, repeat 5 times)

## Tracking Progress

Keep a notebook or use your phone to track two things:

1. **Free throw percentage.** Shoot 10 free throws at the end of every workout. Track your daily percentage. Over 19 days, you should see consistent improvement.

2. **Ball handling confidence.** Rate your comfort level with your weak hand on a scale of 1-10. By the end of the program, your weak hand should feel almost as natural as your strong hand.

## Consistency Is the Secret

The most important thing about this workout isn't any single drill. It's showing up every day. Talent is overrated. Consistency is what builds great players.

Forty-five minutes a day, 19 days in a row. That's all it takes to see real, measurable improvement.
