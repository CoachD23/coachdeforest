The pick-and-roll is the most used action in basketball at every level — from the NBA to middle school. But there's a massive difference between *running* a pick-and-roll and *building an offense around it*.

Most high school teams use the ball screen as a play call. What elite programs do is use it as a *system* — with reads, counters, and built-in adjustments for every defensive response.

## The Ball Screen Is a Read, Not a Play

Here's the biggest mindset shift coaches need to make: the pick-and-roll isn't about getting the ball handler a layup off the screen. It's about creating a 2-on-1 advantage that forces the defense to make a decision.

The defense has five basic options when you run a ball screen:

1. **Hedge hard** — the screener's defender jumps out to slow the ball
2. **Drop** — the screener's defender sinks back into the paint
3. **Switch** — the defenders switch assignments
4. **Ice/push** — they force the ball handler away from the screen
5. **Trap/blitz** — both defenders jump the ball handler

Each response creates a different scoring opportunity. If your players can read which one is happening, the offense becomes almost impossible to guard.

## Reading the Defense in Real Time

The ball handler's reads are straightforward:

**Against a hedge:** Reject the screen and attack the open gap. Or split the hedge with a quick dribble through.

**Against a drop:** Pull up for a jumper. The screener's defender is giving you space — take what they give you.

**Against a switch:** Look for the mismatch immediately. If a big is guarding you, attack off the dribble. If a guard is on the roller, throw it inside.

**Against ice:** Use a re-screen or a drag screen to get back to your strong hand. Don't fight the ice — counter it.

**Against a trap:** Hit the roller or find the open shooter. Two defenders on the ball means someone is open.

## Building the Counter Game

This is where the Multiple Option system really shines. For every defensive adjustment, there's a built-in counter:

If they hedge → **slip the screener** early before the hedge arrives. The roller catches the ball in space with momentum toward the rim.

If they switch → **run the action again** with the mismatch. Make them switch again, or attack the favorable matchup.

If they drop → **add a second screener** for a stagger or double ball screen. The drop defender can't protect against two screens.

## The Coaching Cheat Sheet

One of the most practical tools I created for the Multiple Option Offense book is a cheat sheet designed for the bench. During a timeout or at halftime, you look at what the defense is doing and the cheat sheet tells you which option to emphasize.

No frantic whiteboard sessions. No guessing. Just a clear, organized response for every defensive adjustment you'll face.

## The Bottom Line

Stop using the pick-and-roll as a play. Start using it as a system. When your players can read the defense and react in real time, you become one of the hardest teams in your league to prepare for.
