If you've ever watched Kansas play under Bill Self, you've seen something that looks effortless — but is anything but. The Jayhawks run a system built on reads, not memorization. That's the core idea behind the Multiple Option Offense, and it's one of the most powerful systems you can install at any level of basketball.

## What Makes It "Multiple Option"?

The name says it all. Rather than running a set play with one intended outcome, the Multiple Option Offense gives your players a series of reads within each possession. The beauty is that the defense dictates what you do — and your players learn to exploit whatever the defense gives them.

At its foundation, you're choosing between a high/low attack and a ball screen attack depending on your personnel. Have a dominant post player? Lean into the high/low. Guards who can create off the dribble? The ball screen game becomes your bread and butter.

## Why Coaches Love It

The biggest complaint I hear from coaches at the high school level is: "I don't have the athletes to run that system." The Multiple Option Offense solves that problem because it adapts to what you have, not what you wish you had.

Here's what makes it special:

- **Flexibility**: You don't need a specific type of player. You need players who can read and react.
- **Counter-heavy**: Every action has a built-in counter. If the defense takes away the first look, the second look opens up naturally.
- **Coaching cheat sheet**: One of the things I built into my book is a cheat sheet for in-game adjustments. When the other team makes a defensive switch, you already have the answer ready.

## Installing It at the High School Level

I've coached this system with teams that had a 6'5" center and teams where my tallest player was 6'0". Both groups found success because the reads are the same regardless of size.

The key to installation is starting simple. Don't try to teach every option in the first week. Start with the base action, let your players get comfortable with the primary read, then layer in the counters over time.

## The Bill Self Influence

What makes Bill Self's offense so effective isn't complexity — it's simplicity disguised as complexity. The defense sees multiple looks, but the players are making binary decisions: if the defender does X, I do Y. That's it.

When I studied his system, I realized that the best offenses in basketball aren't the ones with the most plays. They're the ones where players understand *why* they're doing what they're doing. That understanding creates confidence, and confidence creates execution under pressure.

## The Bottom Line

If you're looking for an offensive system that doesn't require All-Americans to be effective, the Multiple Option Offense is worth your time. It rewards smart players, adapts to your roster, and gives you a framework for making halftime adjustments that actually work.
