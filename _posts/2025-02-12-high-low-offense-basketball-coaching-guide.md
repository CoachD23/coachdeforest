The high-low offense is one of the most underutilized offensive concepts in high school basketball. Coaches see it on film from college programs and assume it requires elite bigs to work. That's a misconception — and it's one that's costing teams easy baskets.

## What Makes the High-Low So Effective?

The high-low attack works because it puts the defense in a bind. When you position one post player at the elbow and another on the block, the defense has to decide: do they front the low post or help from the high post?

Either way, someone is open. That's the beauty of the system.

The high post player becomes a distributor. They catch the ball facing the basket with vision of the entire floor. From there, they can:

- Feed the low post over the top of a fronting defender
- Hit a cutter coming off a screen
- Take a short jumper if their defender sags
- Reverse the ball to the weak side for an open three

Every option is built into the system. The defense makes the choice, and your offense reacts.

## Why Bill Self Builds His Offense Around This Concept

Bill Self's Kansas teams have been dominant for decades, and the high-low game is a cornerstone of his approach. Self doesn't ask his players to memorize 40 plays. Instead, he teaches them to read the defense within a framework — and the high-low is one of his primary frameworks.

What makes Self's version special is the counter game. When defenses adjust to take away the high-low feed, the ball screen attack opens up. When they take away the ball screen, the high-low comes back. It's a constant chess match, and Self's teams are always a move ahead.

## Installing the High-Low at the High School Level

You don't need McDonald's All-Americans to run this. You need two players who can catch and make simple decisions. Here's how I recommend installing it:

**Week 1:** Teach the high-low entry pass. Work on the high post catch facing the basket and the low post seal. Just get the timing down.

**Week 2:** Add the first read — high-low feed vs. short jumper. If the defense fronts low, feed over the top. If they don't, the high post shoots.

**Week 3:** Layer in the weak side action. When the ball goes high-low, the weak side guard lifts to the corner for a kick-out three.

By keeping it simple and progressive, your players build confidence and mastery before you add complexity.

## The Counter Game Changes Everything

What separates a good high-low team from a great one is the counter game. When the defense starts to overplay the high-low action, you need answers ready.

The most effective counter is the ball screen. When the defense collapses on the high-low, pull the high post out and run a pick-and-roll. The defense is already loaded up inside, so the ball handler has space to turn the corner.

This is exactly what the Multiple Option Offense is built on — giving your team answers for every defensive adjustment.

## The Bottom Line

The high-low offense isn't just for elite programs. It's a foundational concept that rewards smart players and creates high-percentage scoring opportunities for any roster.
