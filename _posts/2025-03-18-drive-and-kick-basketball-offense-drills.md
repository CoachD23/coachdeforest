The drive-and-kick is the most efficient action in modern basketball. A player attacks the paint, the defense collapses, and the ball goes out to an open shooter for a three-pointer.

Simple concept. But executing it consistently requires specific training.

## Why the Drive-and-Kick Dominates

The math is straightforward. When a player drives into the paint, the defense has two choices:

1. Let them score a layup (2 points, high percentage)
2. Help and leave a shooter open (potential 3 points, high percentage from an open look)

Both outcomes favor the offense. The defense is choosing between bad and worse. That's why the drive-and-kick is the foundation of the Dribble Drive Motion Offense.

## The Four Drive-and-Kick Drills

**Drill 1: 2-on-1 Drive-and-Kick.**

Setup: Ball handler on the wing. Shooter in the corner. One defender in help position.

Action: The ball handler drives middle. The defender either stays home (layup) or helps (kick to the corner). The ball handler reads the help and makes the right pass.

This is the most basic drive-and-kick rep. Run it 20 times per practice from each side.

**Drill 2: 3-on-3 Kick-Out Rotation.**

Setup: 3-on-3 half court. Ball starts on the wing.

Action: When the ball handler drives, the other two players rotate to create kick-out angles. The driver finds the open shooter. After the kick-out, the shooter can catch-and-shoot OR drive again if the close-out is too aggressive.

This drill teaches the critical rotation rules that make the DDMO work.

**Drill 3: Drive-and-Drop.**

Setup: Ball handler on the wing. Big man on the block. Shooter in the corner. 3-on-3 live.

Action: The ball handler drives. If the big man's defender helps on the drive, the driver drops the ball off to the big man for a layup. If the corner defender helps, the kick-out three is open.

This adds the drop-off pass — the third option in the drive-and-kick game.

**Drill 4: Full-Court Drive-and-Kick Scrimmage.**

Setup: 5-on-5 full court. Made baskets only count if they come from a drive-and-kick or drive-and-drop.

Action: Teams play live, but only layups off drives, kick-out threes, and drop-off layups count as points. This forces the offense to attack the paint on every possession and make the right pass.

## The Pass Out of the Drive

The hardest part of the drive-and-kick isn't the drive — it's the pass. Teaching players to pass accurately while in the air or off-balance is crucial.

Drill this specific skill: have the driver attack at full speed, jump toward the basket, and make a kick-out pass to the corner *in the air*. It takes reps, but once your players can do this, the drive-and-kick becomes lethal.
