Bill Self has won a national championship, made 15 consecutive Big 12 regular season titles (at one point), and consistently fielded one of the most efficient offenses in college basketball. But what makes his system so effective isn't complexity — it's elegant simplicity.

## The Foundation: Reads Over Plays

If you watch Kansas on film, you'll notice something striking. They don't run a huge playbook. In fact, their half-court offense is built around a handful of core actions. The difference is that each action has multiple reads, and the players have the freedom to take what the defense gives them.

This is the heart of what I call the Multiple Option Offense. It's not about having the most plays. It's about having the best reads within a simple framework.

## Self's Two Primary Attacks

Kansas typically operates out of two primary offensive modes:

**The High-Low Attack.** When Kansas has a strong post presence, they use the high-low game as their bread and butter. One big at the elbow, one on the block. The high post catches and makes a decision: feed low, hit a cutter, or take the short jumper.

**The Ball Screen Attack.** When Kansas has elite guard play (which is most years), they shift emphasis to the ball screen game. The pick-and-roll creates the initial advantage, and then players read the defense's coverage to determine the best scoring option.

The genius is that both attacks operate within the same framework. The spacing is the same. The weak-side action is the same. Only the primary entry changes — and that's determined by personnel, not by a new playbook.

## What Film Study Reveals

When I broke down over 50 Kansas possessions for my book, clear patterns emerged:

**Binary decisions.** Self's players aren't thinking through complex decision trees. They're making simple yes/no reads. "Is the defense helping? Yes → kick it. No → attack."

**Patience.** Kansas rarely shoots early in the shot clock. They make the defense work, probe for weaknesses, and then strike. The second and third actions of a possession are often more dangerous than the first.

**Counter-ready.** Every time the defense takes away one option, Kansas immediately attacks the counter. Hedge the ball screen? The slip is there. Front the low post? The high-low feed goes over the top.

## Why This Translates to High School

The biggest misconception about Self's offense is that you need Kansas-level talent to run it. You don't. You need players who can make simple reads and trust the system.

I've installed this system with teams at the high school level — teams without a single Division I prospect — and it works. Why? Because the reads are universal. The principles of spacing, ball movement, and reading the defense apply at every level.

The key is installation. You can't dump the entire system on your team in the first week. Start with the base action, teach the primary read, build confidence, then layer in counters. The book walks you through this exact progression.

## The Coaching Cheat Sheet

One of the most practical elements I included in the book is a coaching cheat sheet designed for game day. When the other team makes a defensive adjustment, you check the cheat sheet and know exactly which option to emphasize.

It's the same principle Self uses at Kansas. He doesn't reinvent the offense at halftime. He shifts emphasis within the existing framework. And now you can do the same thing.
