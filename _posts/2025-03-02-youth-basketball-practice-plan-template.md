A great practice doesn't happen by accident. It happens because the coach walked in with a plan.

But here's the thing: most youth coaches don't have time to create a new practice plan from scratch every day. Between work, family, and actually coaching, who has time for that?

That's why I use a template. The structure stays the same, but the drills rotate based on what the team needs that week. It's efficient, consistent, and it works.

## The Practice Plan Framework

Every youth basketball practice should hit four key areas:

1. **Ball handling and toughness** — the foundation of everything
2. **Individual skill work** — shooting, passing, footwork
3. **Team concepts** — offense, defense, communication
4. **Competition** — scrimmage or competitive drills

The time allocation shifts based on age group, but the structure remains constant.

## The 70-Minute Template

**Warm-Up & Ball Handling (12 minutes)**

Start with the ball in every player's hands from the moment they step on the court. No running laps — those minutes are wasted.

- 3 min: Stationary dribbling series (right, left, alternating, crossover)
- 3 min: Movement dribbling (zig-zag, full court, speed change)
- 3 min: Ball toughness drill (dribble tag, gauntlet, or two-ball)
- 3 min: Partner passing (chest pass, bounce pass, skip pass)

**Individual Skill Stations (15 minutes)**

Set up three stations and rotate every 5 minutes:

- Station 1: Shooting form (close-range, focus on mechanics)
- Station 2: 1-on-1 moves (jab step, crossover, shot fake)
- Station 3: Defensive stance and slides

Every player hits every station. Keep groups small so reps are high.

**Team Concepts (15 minutes)**

This is where you teach your offense and defense. For youth teams, keep it simple:

- 8 min: Offensive concept for the week (spacing, cutting, screening)
- 7 min: Defensive concept for the week (help defense, close-outs, rebounding)

Use walk-throughs first, then build up to game speed.

**Competitive Drills (15 minutes)**

Everything should be competitive. Winners stay, losers rotate. Add stakes — losing team does push-ups, winning team starts with the ball in scrimmage.

- 5 min: 3-on-3 half court (work on offensive and defensive concepts)
- 10 min: 5-on-5 scrimmage (coach on the fly, but let them play)

**Cool-Down (8 minutes)**

- 5 min: Free throws (track makes out of 10 — personal accountability)
- 3 min: Team huddle and positive reinforcement

## Adjusting for Age Groups

**Ages 6-8:** More ball handling, more games, less standing around. Reduce team concepts to 8 minutes and add more fun competitive drills.

**Ages 9-11:** The sweet spot for this template. Players are old enough to understand concepts but young enough to need repetition.

**Ages 12-14:** Increase team concept time to 20 minutes and add more advanced ball toughness drills. These players can handle more complexity.

## The Key: Consistency

The most important thing about this template isn't any individual drill — it's the consistency. When players know the practice structure, they can focus on getting better instead of wondering what's next.

And when your coaching staff knows the structure, practice runs itself. You spend less time organizing and more time teaching.
