Every high school coach watches NBA basketball. And every high school coach has thought: "I wish my team could move the ball like that."

Here's the truth: they can. Not at NBA speed, and not with NBA skill levels — but the *principles* that drive NBA motion offenses work at every level. You just have to know how to adapt them.

## What Makes NBA Motion Offenses Tick

When you watch the San Antonio Spurs or Golden State Warriors move the ball, it looks like choreography. But it's not a set play — it's a series of principles that the players execute based on reads.

The core principles are universal:

**Pace of the pass.** NBA teams zip the ball. Every pass has purpose and velocity. At the high school level, this means drilling quick ball movement every single practice. Soft, lazy passes get intercepted.

**Screen and relocate.** After every screen, both the screener and the cutter have a job. The screener either rolls to the basket or pops to an open spot. The cutter reads the defense and makes a decision. Nobody stands still.

**Two-side action.** The ball is on one side, but the offense is happening on both sides. Weak-side screening, cutting, and spacing are what create the open looks that make NBA offenses look easy.

## The Translation Problem

Most coaches fail when they try to run NBA offense because they copy the plays instead of the principles. The Spurs don't run the same play every possession — they run the same *principles* every possession.

At the high school level, you need to simplify the reads and increase the structure. Give players fewer options, not more. Let them master one or two reads before adding complexity.

## Three NBA Concepts Your Team Can Run Tomorrow

**1. The Spurs Swing.** Ball goes from wing → top → opposite wing. After each pass, the passer sets a screen for someone. After three passes, someone is open. It's simple, it teaches ball movement, and it works against any defense.

**2. The Elevator Screen.** Two players stand side by side. A cutter runs between them, and they close the "elevator doors" behind the cutter. The cutter pops out for an open jump shot. It's an NBA action that high school players absolutely love running.

**3. Dribble Handoff to Ball Screen.** The big comes up to the wing and hands the ball off to the guard. Immediately after the handoff, the big sets a ball screen. The defense has to guard two actions in quick succession — and one of them is usually open.

## Building the Motion Culture

Running motion offense is as much about culture as it is about X's and O's. Your players have to buy into the idea that the extra pass leads to better shots. That means rewarding assists in practice, celebrating hockey assists, and benching players who hold the ball too long.

Popovich famously benched players — even stars — for not moving the ball. That sent a message to the entire roster. You have the same power.
