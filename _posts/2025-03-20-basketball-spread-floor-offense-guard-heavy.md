You look at your roster and see four guards and a 6'1" power forward. No traditional big man. No dominant post player. You think you're in trouble.

You're not. You're sitting on a goldmine — if you run the right offense.

## The Guard-Heavy Advantage

Having a roster full of guards isn't a weakness. It's an advantage — if you play to your strengths instead of trying to force a post-oriented offense.

Here's what guard-heavy rosters do well:

**Speed.** Guards are fast. Use that speed in transition and in your half-court attack. Get up the floor, push tempo, and make bigger, slower teams uncomfortable.

**Ball handling.** Multiple ball handlers means the press doesn't hurt you. It means any player can create off the dribble. It means your spacing is always good because everyone is comfortable with the ball in their hands.

**Shooting.** Guards tend to be your best shooters. When four of five players can knock down threes, the floor is spread to the maximum. Driving lanes are wide open.

## Why the DDMO Is the Perfect Fit

The Dribble Drive Motion Offense was literally designed for guard-heavy teams. John Calipari popularized it at Memphis with a lineup that often featured four guards and a small forward playing center.

The DDMO takes everything guard-heavy rosters do well — speed, ball handling, shooting — and builds the offense around those skills.

The spread-floor alignment puts four shooters around the arc. The ball handler attacks the gap. When the defense collapses, the kick-out three is open. When they don't collapse, the driver finishes at the rim.

## Installation for Guard-Heavy Teams

**Step 1: Establish spacing.** Your four perimeter players need to be in their spots: the two wings, the corner, and the top. Spacing is non-negotiable.

**Step 2: Identify your primary drivers.** Even with four guards, one or two will be your best attackers. They get the first touch most possessions.

**Step 3: Teach the relocation rules.** When a player drives, everyone else moves. The rules are simple: fill behind the drive, space to the open spot, be ready to shoot.

**Step 4: Add the drag screen.** Even without a traditional big, you can use a guard-to-guard screen at the top of the key to create driving angles. This is the DDMO's secret weapon for small lineups.

## Addressing the Rebounding Concern

The biggest concern with a guard-heavy, spread-floor offense is rebounding. Here's how you handle it:

**Crash two on every shot.** Designate two players to crash the offensive glass while three get back in transition.

**Shoot high-percentage shots.** The DDMO creates open threes and layups. Open shots have a higher make rate, which means fewer offensive rebounds needed.

**Win the possession game.** If you're not turning the ball over and you're forcing turnovers on defense, rebounding becomes less critical. The DDMO, with its ball-handling emphasis, naturally reduces turnovers.
