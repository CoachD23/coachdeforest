The corner three is the most efficient shot in basketball. It's the shortest three-point shot on the floor, it creates optimal spacing for drive-and-kick offense, and the best offensive systems in the world are designed to generate it.

The San Antonio Spurs have built entire offensive sequences around creating open corner threes. And your team can do the same.

## Why the Corner Three Is So Valuable

The numbers don't lie. Across the NBA, the corner three is consistently the highest-percentage three-point shot. At the high school level, the margin is even bigger because the three-point line is shorter and the corner distance advantage is more pronounced.

But the value goes beyond just the shot itself. When you have shooters stationed in the corners, it stretches the defense horizontally. That stretching creates driving lanes in the middle of the floor, which leads to layups — the most efficient shot in basketball.

So the corner three isn't just about threes. It's about the entire offensive structure.

## Spurs Spacing Principles

San Antonio's offensive spacing starts with a simple rule: keep the corners occupied. When the ball is on one side of the floor, the weak-side corner always has a player in it.

This creates a problem for the defense. If the help defender sags off the corner to protect the paint, the kick-out three is open. If they stay on the corner shooter, the driving lane is open.

It's a lose-lose for the defense, and it's a direct result of proper spacing.

## Building Corner Three Actions Into Your Offense

You don't need to overhaul your entire offense. You need to add a few principles:

**1. Default to the corner.** When players don't have the ball and aren't involved in the action, their default position should be the corner. It's the most valuable "doing nothing" spot on the floor.

**2. Drive-and-kick reps.** Every practice, drill the drive-and-kick to the corner. The ball handler attacks the gap, draws the help defender, and kicks to the open corner shooter. This should be the most practiced action on your team.

**3. Baseline drift.** When the ball is on the opposite side, have your wing players drift to the corner. This is passive movement that creates massive spacing advantages.

## The Spurs' Favorite Corner Three Actions

**The Swing-Swing-Corner.** Ball reverses from one wing to the top to the opposite wing. The original wing player drifts to the corner. The new ball handler drives middle, and the corner three is open.

**The Ball Screen Corner.** The ball handler comes off a ball screen toward the middle of the floor. The screener rolls to the basket, pulling the defense inside. The corner shooter, who has been standing still, is now wide open.

**The Skip Pass.** When the ball is on one side and the defense is loaded up, a skip pass directly to the corner is one of the hardest passes to defend. It travels over the top of the defense and arrives at the most efficient shot location on the floor.
