The Golden State Warriors changed basketball forever with pace-and-space offense. The Houston Rockets took it even further. Now, every level of basketball is embracing the idea that speed, shooting, and spacing can beat size.

If your team is smaller than the competition, this is your blueprint.

## What Is Pace and Space?

Pace and space is an offensive philosophy built on two principles:

**Pace:** Push the tempo. Get up the floor fast. Make the other team play at your speed, not theirs.

**Space:** Spread the floor with shooters. Create driving lanes. Force the defense to guard the entire court.

When you combine pace and space, something powerful happens: bigger teams can't keep up. Their bigs are too slow to get back in transition. Their help defense is spread too thin. And their size advantage in the post disappears because the game is played on the perimeter.

## The Three Pillars of Pace and Space

**1. Transition offense.** Every defensive rebound, steal, or made basket by the opponent should trigger an immediate push. Your guards should be sprinting up the floor before the ball is even secured.

The goal isn't to score every possession in transition — it's to push the tempo so fast that the defense can't set up. Even if you don't score in the first three seconds, you've caught them scrambling.

**2. Three-point shooting.** In a pace-and-space offense, three-point shooting isn't optional. You need at least three players on the floor who can make open threes consistently.

This doesn't mean every shot should be a three. It means the *threat* of the three keeps the defense spread. When defenders have to close out on shooters, driving lanes open up.

**3. Ball screen offense.** The pick-and-roll is the engine of pace-and-space basketball. The ball handler uses the screen to create a 2-on-1 advantage, and the spacing gives them room to operate.

In the DDMO, the ball screen leads to either a driving lane (finish at the rim or drop-off) or a kick-out three. Both are high-percentage shots.

## Why Smaller Teams Should Embrace This

If you're a coach who loses the size battle every game, stop trying to compete inside. Start competing in the areas where you have an advantage:

**Speed.** Smaller teams are almost always faster. Use that speed to create transition opportunities and tire out the other team's bigs.

**Shooting.** If you can't score inside, score from outside. Three points beats two points every time, and open threes from good shooters are high-percentage shots.

**Conditioning.** Pace-and-space is exhausting for the defense. If your team is better conditioned (and they should be if you're smaller), the fourth quarter belongs to you.

## Building the System

The Dribble Drive Motion Offense is the perfect vehicle for pace-and-space basketball. Its spread-floor alignment creates maximum spacing. Its drive-and-kick action generates open threes. And its aggressive, attacking nature pushes tempo naturally.

Start by spreading the floor and letting your guards attack. The results will speak for themselves.
