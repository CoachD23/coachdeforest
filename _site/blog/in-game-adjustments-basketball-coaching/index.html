          <p>You can have the best game plan in the world and still lose if you can't adjust. Basketball is fluid, unpredictable, and constantly evolving within a single game. The coach who prepared for man-to-man defense suddenly sees a 2-3 zone. The point guard who was dominating the first half picks up his third foul. The opposing coach switches to a full-court press that disrupts your tempo.</p>
<p>What you do next is what separates good coaches from great ones.</p>
<h2>See the Game, Don't Just Watch It</h2>
<p>Most coaches watch the game from the sideline. Great coaches see patterns. There's a difference. Watching means reacting to what just happened. Seeing means recognizing what's about to happen.</p>
<p>Develop the habit of tracking defensive tendencies in real time. Is their help-side defense cheating toward the ball? Are they switching screens or fighting through them? Is their center slow to recover after hedging the pick-and-roll? These patterns tell you where the opportunities are before they become obvious.</p>
<h2>The Halftime Framework</h2>
<p>Halftime adjustments get all the attention, but the reality is you only have a few minutes and your players can only absorb one or two changes. Here's the framework I use: identify the single biggest problem, identify the single biggest opportunity, and address both as simply as possible.</p>
<p>Don't overhaul your game plan at halftime. Don't introduce new plays or new defensive schemes. Adjust what you're already running. If your motion offense is stalling because the defense is denying the wing entry, the adjustment isn't a new offense — it's a backdoor cut or a ball screen to create the same entry from a different angle.</p>
<h2>Timeout Adjustments</h2>
<p>Timeouts are even more compressed than halftime. You have sixty seconds or thirty seconds, and your players are tired, emotional, and distracted. The best timeout adjustments are one sentence long.</p>
<p>"They're leaving the corner open on every ball screen — find it." That's it. One adjustment, clearly communicated, immediately actionable. Save the whiteboard diagrams for practice.</p>
<h2>Studying Other Systems</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to develop your adjustment ability is studying how elite programs run their offenses. When you understand the principles behind multiple offensive systems, you can borrow concepts on the fly. Studying how Bill Self runs his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kansas-Jayhawks-Multiple-Option-Offense/dp/1521289719">Multiple Option Offense at Kansas</a> taught me how to create secondary actions off primary sets — the kind of counters that turn a dead possession into a scoring opportunity.</p>
<p>The more systems you understand, the bigger your adjustment toolkit becomes.</p>
<h2>Preparing to Adjust</h2>
<p>Here's the paradox of in-game adjustments: the best ones are prepared in advance. Before every game, I identify three or four "if-then" scenarios. If they zone us, we run this. If they press, we break it this way. If our post player is in foul trouble, we go small with this lineup.</p>
<p>These aren't scripted adjustments — they're prepared options. When the situation arises during the game, you don't have to think. You've already done the thinking. You just execute.</p>
<h2>Trust Your Players</h2>
<p>The final piece of in-game adjustments is trusting your players to make their own. If you've coached them well, if they understand the principles of your system, they'll see adjustments you miss. The best basketball happens when players and coaches are reading the game together and adjusting in real time.</p>
<p>Build that trust in practice. Give your players decision-making responsibility. Let them call their own plays in scrimmages. The more you empower them to think, the less you need to micromanage from the sideline.</p>
