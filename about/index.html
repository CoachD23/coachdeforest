        <p>Lee DeForest, a basketball coach for almost 20 years, learned to love the game after spending time in the gym with his father and learned to love writing after graduating from law school.</p>
        <p>Growing up in a small town in Kentucky with big dreams, he went on to become most noted for his variation of the Princeton Offense, winning a state title in 2011. His books on the Princeton Basketball Offense have helped him make friends all over the world.</p>
        <p>Honorably discharged from the U.S. Army Reserve in 2014, Coach DeForest currently resides in Texas with his wife and parrot. He continues to write and share his coaching knowledge with the next generation of basketball minds.</p>
