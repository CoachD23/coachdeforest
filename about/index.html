        <h2 class="section-title">From the Court to the Page</h2>
        <p>Coach DeForest's coaching career spans over two decades of work at every level of the game. From youth development leagues to elite high school programs, every season brought new lessons — and a deeper understanding of what it really takes to build winners.</p>
        <p>After years of coaches asking him to share his systems, drills, and philosophies, Coach DeForest decided to put pen to paper. The result? A growing library of basketball ebooks that distill the best of his experience into practical, ready-to-use content.</p>
        <p>His books aren't academic — they're direct, opinionated, and built for coaches who want to get better <em>now</em>. Every chapter is a tool. Every page is a competitive advantage.</p>
